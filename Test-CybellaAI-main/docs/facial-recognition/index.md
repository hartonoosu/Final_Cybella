# Facial Recognition Documentation

Welcome to the Facial Recognition system documentation. This system provides real-time emotion detection through webcam analysis, allowing your application to respond to users' emotional states.

## Documentation Sections

- [System Overview](./SystemOverview.md) - High-level architecture and process flow
- [Quick Start Guide](./QuickStart.md) - Basic integration steps
- [Advanced Features](./AdvancedFeatures.md) - Customization options
- [Troubleshooting](./Troubleshooting.md) - Common issues and solutions
- [API Reference](./APIReference.md) and [API Reference (Continued)](./APIReference-Continued.md) - Complete function documentation

## Key Features

- **Real-time emotion detection** from facial expressions
- **Multiple emotion categories**: happy, sad, neutral, angry, fearful, surprised
- **Confidence scoring** for detected emotions
- **Emotion stabilization** to prevent flickering between different emotions
- **Enhanced accuracy** through facial landmark analysis
- **Performance optimization** for smooth operation
- **Comprehensive error handling** for robustness

## Getting Started

To quickly integrate facial recognition into your application, see the [Quick Start Guide](./QuickStart.md).

For a deeper understanding of the system architecture, refer to the [System Overview](./SystemOverview.md).

## Emotion Detection Capabilities

The system can detect and classify the following emotions:

- **Happy**: Smiles, laughter, positive expressions
- **Sad**: Frowns, downturned mouth, negative expressions
- **Angry**: Furrowed brows, intense expressions
- **Surprised**: Raised eyebrows, wide eyes, open mouth
- **Fearful**: Wide eyes, raised eyebrows, tense expressions
- **Neutral**: Balanced, non-expressive face

## Technology

The facial recognition system uses face-api.js, a JavaScript implementation of various face detection and recognition models. It employs:

- TinyFaceDetector for efficient face detection
- SSD Mobilenet for higher accuracy detection (when available)
- FaceExpressionNet for emotion recognition
- FaceLandmark68Net for detailed facial feature analysis

## Privacy Considerations

When implementing facial recognition:

- Always request explicit user permission
- Clearly indicate when the camera is active
- Process data locally (no data is sent to external servers)
- Allow users to disable the feature easily
- Consider adding a privacy policy explaining how facial data is used
